## Introduction to Datta Structures

- A data sturcture is a way to store and organize data in a computer, so that it can be used efficiently
 
- We talk about data-structures as:

 1) Mathematical/logical models or Abstract data types
    
 2) Implementation


## List [ADT]

- Store a given number of elements

- Read elements by posiotion

- Modify element at a position

Arrays [Concrete Implementation]


## Linked List

##### Abstract data types [ADTs]

- Define data and operations, but no implementation.

-Arrays, Linked List, Stack, Queue, Tree, Graph...
    
1)Logical view

2)Operations

3)Cost of operations

4)Implementation
